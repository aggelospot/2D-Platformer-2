# 2D-Platformer-2
2D Platformer 

Currently a Sandbox with only 1 level, more levels will be added. Made with Pycharm

__The goal of this project is to train an algorithm to beat the game on it's own.__


__Controls:__

-----Use the arrow keys to move and Spacebar to shoot.
  
__Current main mechanics:__
  
-----Platforms that move horizontaly and vertical
  
-----Gravity for the player
  
-----Projectiles that shoot from the player sprite and get deleted when they collide with enemies/platforms
  
-----Animations for enemies/player
  
-----Invanurability for 1 second when the player takes damage.

More complex mechanics might be added depending on how difficult it will be for the algorith to beat the game  

__Current known bugs:__

-----Sometimes projectiles don't damage the enemies when colliding from the back because i need to crop the animations more precisely

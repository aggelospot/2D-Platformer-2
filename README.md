# 2D-Platformer-2
2D Platformer 

Currently a Sandbox with only 1 level, more levels will be added.
The goal of this project is to train an algorithm to beat the game on it's own.

Controls:
  Use the arrow keys to move and Spacebar to shoot.
  
Current main mechanics: 
  
  Platforms that move horizontaly and vertical
  
  Gravity for the player
  
  Projectiles that shoot from the player sprite and get deleted when they collide with enemies/platforms
  
  Animations for enemies/player
  
  Invanurability for 1 second when the player takes damage.

More complex mechanics might be added depending on how difficult it will be for the algorith to beat the game  

Current known bugs:
  Sometimes projectiles don't damage the enemies when colliding from the back because i need to crop the animations more precisely
